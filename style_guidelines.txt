Overall look and feel: 

As a whole, Ramble should be simple, intuitive and welcoming for the users, with a priority on easy-to-understand navigation and options that stand out. Both the app and the website will have a relaxing and layed-back feel to them.

Iconography:

The icons will mainly be plain not to clash with the app's aesthetic and the colors will stand out from the background with a higher color contrast all while adhering with the theme.

Link:

Links will not be underlined and text will be navy blue.

Buttons:

Buttons will have a rectangular design and be placed in the header. A green background will be used with a hover action listenner that changes the background colour of the button to blue and the text to green.
